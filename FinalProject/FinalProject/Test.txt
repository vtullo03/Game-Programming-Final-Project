Teammates!? Friends!? To hell with that! Why am I inferior to you!? I was extremely particular about my life, my grades, my public image! So someone would want me around! I am an ace detective! A celebrity!  But you... You're just some criminal trash living in an attic!? So how!?  How does someone like you have things I don't!? How can such a worthless piece of trash be more special than me!? This argument is MEANINGLESS!!
